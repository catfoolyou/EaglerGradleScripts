# EaglerGradleScripts
A set of scripts for the Eaglercraft 1.12 desktop runtime for running with a bundled java installation.

You probably wont even need these, but I'm keeping them around for development purposes.

The batchfile is needed to run the actual runtime, while the gradle files should only be used for compilation.
